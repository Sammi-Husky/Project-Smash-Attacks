Project Smash Attacks
=====================
Project Smash attacks is a application that aims to edit the character files that control the movesets in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Originally the program was developed and maintained by Phantom Wings, and now his work may be continued here.

This repo serves as a place where interested parties may find and easily modify the source code in an attempt to further the functionality of the application. While other tools have been developed since its creation, PSA has been a comfortable and familiar interface for editing the character files, and therefore i believe still has potential to improve.


Future Plans

Article support  
Fighter.pac support  
Item support
